# Windmine 
A Classic Windows Minesweeper clone made in Deplhi 7

# About this project
Windmine is a Minesweeper clone made in 2003 as a challenge assignment for my Fundaments of Computing II chair, part of the Computing Science graduation course at Rio de Janeiro Federal University (UFRJ). It was made from scratch, using the Delphi 7 IDE for writing the code and Microsoft Paint to create the graphic resources. It implements almost every mechanic from the original Minesweeper, except for Audio support. That means everything else - preset game modes, custom game mode, toggable use of question marks to mark unopened cells, even the usually forgotten feature of never having the first clicked cell be a mine - are in there, working exactly like the original version that used to come preinstalled on Windows up to XP.

The name "Windmine" is a pun with the original executable name (Winmine.exe) and my self-bestowed dev moniker (Windblow), and it seemed really amusing at the time so I kept it

Since the current incarnation of Minesweeper by Microsoft is an ad-ridden freemium shenanigans with nowhere near the fast-paced timed gameplay of yore, and since even the "original" version they offer in their store is not the actual thing - and since Embarcadero's Delphi 11 was extremely game with opening and building a project from 20 years ago - I decided to put this up here for grabs. Enjoy!

(As a matter of fact, you can find other clones of the OG Minesweeper in MS Store, but the one I found was a 130MB download?? Hard pass)

# Building
Download and install the latest community-licenced (free) edition of Delphi, open the project, build it, and that's it. The executable is pretty self-contained, but it will look for a configuration file on the same folder and create a new one if it can't find it. The config file keeps the user preferences and the record times for each preset game mode. WARNING: Editing it to add 1s times to every mode would be cheating!
